ASU Graders:

All code was sourced from lectures from Module 5. 

Bill went over this challenge and gave us tips and strategies during office hours, 
that is the extent of the 'tutoring' I received from anyone.

I received no help from outside sources.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
